These are my Vim configuration files and plugins. This is a very python oriented setting. I primarily code in Python and at times a bit of JavaScript. These files are constantly evolving, so please feel free to comment on my choices.

Most of the plugins are done using Pathogen(including itself). The non pathogen plugins are found in the plugin directory. Currently these are the plugins in the plugin directory:

        colorx.vim - this is used to launch the colorpicker in Mac
        hexHighlight.vim - this is used to display the actual color of a hex. 

My .vimrc file is constantly being updated. Hope I remember to commit the changes. I have tried to comment where ever necessary. There is a much modified version of the colour scheme clouds. I have called it cloudsxterm. It works on terminal and gui.
